## About
mosus is a fun game to play on Discord with up to 15 players. It is a game of deception and finesse. You're given a random word, must sneak it in your messages on the server as subtly as possible... hoping that nobody notices it. 

To know more about the game's precise rules and course, check out this [wiki article].
